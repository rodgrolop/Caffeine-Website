**Khan Academy may share or transfer your information in the following ways:**

#### **When information is visible to others on the Service by default**

Certain features and functions of the Service may share your information with or make it accessible to others. For example, your information may be visible to others in the following circumstances:

-   **Information you post to public spaces of the Service.**When you post a question or answer to the Service, your profile, which could include your name and short biography, as well as the content of your posted comment, is visible to others on the Service. As with most online services, once your information is available to others online, it may be collected and used by the recipients or any other website visitor without restriction. As with online safety in general, consider which personal information (if any) you want to share in your profile or posts. We strongly advise that you do not use your real name (or other information that could be used to identify you) when creating your username (or profile).
-   **Information shared when your account is connected to another user account.**¬†When your account is connected to a teacher or coach, or your parent, that person will be able to see your profile information and your learning activity on the Service, such as which videos you have watched, the questions and responses you post, and other usage information. This information may include your name (not only your username) as well as information in your account profile and your account settings.

#### **With your consent or according to your instructions**

You may provide consent or authorization to share your information with third party applications or services in several ways. Please note that these third parties are not governed by Khan Academy or the terms of this Privacy Policy. We recommend you review the privacy policy of any third party application or service before authorizing its access to your Khan Academy account information.

-   **We may share information with third-party applications that you authorize.**¬†Third-party application developers and service providers may build complementary services for our platform, such as a mobile application for blind or low-vision learners. They may also use our Khan Academy content to build unaffiliated applications and services. If you connect your Khan Academy account to a third-party application or service, or approve access to your Khan Academy account by a third party, you consent to Khan Academy sharing your information with that third party.
-   **We may share information with¬†**t**hird-party Single Sign On tools that you choose.¬†**Khan Academy provides you with opportunities to register an account with (and/or sign on to) Khan Academy by using a Single Sign On Authentication Service.

In certain circumstances, Khan Academy may share de-identified or aggregated information that does not reasonably identify you as an individual for various purposes. For example, we may share de-identified information with business partners to improve our Service or offerings or to conduct educational research. If we disclose information to third parties for research or product development purposes, such information will be aggregated and/or de-identified to reasonably avoid identification of specific individuals.

#### **We will share information with employees and service providers**

In order to provide our Service, Khan Academy may share information with our employees and trusted vendors, third party service providers or other individuals, such as entities providing billing, customer support, analytics, hosting, marketing and similar services.

Sponsorship and Advertising
---------------------------

As a nonprofit organization, Khan Academy relies on our sponsors, donors, and other contributors to provide funding necessary to provide the free Service to our users. From time to time, we permit third parties to sponsor content displayed on our Service.

-   For example, for-profit organizations may wish to sponsor all content related to a particular educational topic, such as astronomy or biology.
-   Sponsored content will always be labeled (e.g., "Sponsored by ___").
-   Khan Academy does not share any of your personal information with these sponsors without your consent. We do not provide these sponsors with the ability to track or collect information about our site visitors or users.

Khan Academy does not display third party advertisements on our Service. We may, from time to time, incorporate content or link to content provided by third parties that may be of interest to you and relevant to the educational context of our Service. Some of these materials or websites may include branding or advertisements as permitted by the third party owner or operator. For more information, please review¬†[Links to third parties](https://www.khanacademy.org/about/privacy-policy#third-parties).

Please note that we use our best efforts and take multiple steps to avoid the collection of information for targeted advertising purposes when we believe the Service is being used by Students or Children.

-   For example, we take steps to inhibit third party advertising networks from collecting information for targeted advertising purposes on webpages with child-directed content or when a Student or Child User logs into the Service.
-   Khan Academy uses the available privacy functionality in YouTube to display video content on YouTube (see additional information under "Learn More").

We have turned on "Privacy-Enhanced Mode" for YouTube videos displayed on the Service. This means that YouTube does not place cookies or track viewing behavior for advertising purposes. Our student-facing content does not embed any YouTube videos that are not part of our content. We disabled certain functionality on YouTube (called "rel" functionality), so that content outside of our content is not played. We also use Google's "child-directed treatment" tags to alert Google that our YouTube videos may be viewed by children or students. For more information, please see¬†[Google's privacy practices](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners).

We understand that your personal information is important to you, and that is why you have choices in how your personal information is used and shared. We want you to have access to your personal information, so that you can help keep it as accurate as possible.

-   Choose whether to add a coach to your account

#### **You may use the Service without creating an account**

You can access most of our online resources without providing personal information. If you do not create an account, however, Khan Academy will not be able to provide you with certain features and functionalities found on our Service. You can still view content and complete exercises without an account, but you will not have full account features (such as seeing your progress in mastering skills and keeping track of your learning activity). You may later enable or access those features by providing Khan Academy with the necessary information to create an account.

#### **You may limit the personal information you provide**

You can choose to provide information which does not reasonably identify you to others. For example, we recommend you select a username which is not related to your actual name (or could otherwise be used to identify you). You can also decline to provide any optional information in your public profile.

#### **Community forums are optional**

You choose whether (and how) to participate in publicly accessible forums, such as posting to public spaces of the Service. When you post a question (or answer) to the Service (or otherwise participate in a public forum), your profile (as well as the content of your posted comment) is visible to others on the Service. Our Service offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others. Child Users are not able to post in community forums (as described in¬†[Children's Privacy Notice](https://www.khanacademy.org/about/privacy-policy#childrens-privacy)).

#### **You can disconnect (or choose not to use) third party applications**

You choose which third party applications you want to use and can stop using any such third party applications at any time. This functionality is optional, and entirely up to you. For instance, you can revoke Khan Academy's access to your account on any single sign-on service at any time by updating the appropriate settings in the account preferences of the Authentication Service (or simply by not logging in through that Authentication Service).

#### **You can unsubscribe from optional email messages**

Khan Academy may, from time to time, send you emails regarding our products and Service, or products and services we think you may enjoy. You can choose not to receive these emails by clicking the unsubscribe link in any e-mail or updating your¬†[Settings page](https://www.khanacademy.org/settings/email). Please note that you are not permitted to unsubscribe or opt-out of certain types of messages regarding your account, such as account verification, changes or updates to features of the Service, technical or security notices and certain programmatic communications (such as class assignments).

#### **You can add a coach, teacher or school account to your account**

You can choose to add a coach or teacher to your account so that your coach or teacher can view your account profile and your learning activity on the Service, such as which videos you have watched, the questions and responses you post, and other use information. When your account is connected to a coach, teacher or School on the Service, your coach, teacher or School will be able to see your profile information and your learning activity on the Service. If you link your personal account to a School Account, a connected teacher or School will see your personal learning activity as well as learning activity from School use. A connected coach or teacher may also be able to see your name (not only your username) as well as your email address, if you include that information in your account profile. Please note that some account profile information and teacher connections for certain School Accounts are controlled by the School.

#### **You can learn more about cookies and how to manage cookie settings in our Cookie Notice**

Many web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies or to prompt you before accepting such a cookie. You also can directly opt out of certain third party cookies. Please note that choosing to remove or reject certain cookies might limit your use of the Service. For more information about our use of cookies and other similar technologies, please review our¬†[Cookie Notice](https://www.khanacademy.org/about/cookie-policy).

#### **You can share information about courses you are studying through sharing features**

We offer clearly marked sharing features, which allow you to share information about courses or topics you are learning about through the Service. Using the sharing features is entirely at your option.

 |

Your account settings

#### **Security is important to you and to Khan Academy**

To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting account access or making corrections to your information. For example, we may ask you to provide certain information to confirm your identity, and we may require that you create and use a password to access certain parts of our Service. We strongly encourage you to create and maintain a strong password to help ensure the security of your account.

#### **We use reasonable safeguards to protect our Service and your personal information, but no security measures are perfect**

Khan Academy uses reasonable physical, administrative, and technical safeguards designed to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information we maintain in connection with our Service. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any or all of the information you transmit to Khan Academy. For instance, no Internet service or email message is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, emails sent to or from the Service may not be secure. Please take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email or for support help. Once we receive your transmission of information, Khan Academy makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. When you enter sensitive information, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL) or similar technologies. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by a breach of any of our physical, technical, or administrative safeguards. In the event that any information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and will notify you of the security incident in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

Links to Third Parties
----------------------

The Service may link to and may be linked by websites operated by other entities or individuals. If we include links to third parties and you click on that link, you will be leaving Khan Academy and the privacy policy of that third party applies. Similarly, if you see a link to Khan Academy on a third party website, then the privacy policy of that third party applies.

-   For example:

-   If you click on a link to College Board, then you will go to College Board's website and College Board's privacy policy applies.
-   If you are on the Khan Academy Instagram page, the privacy policy of Instagram applies to that Khan Academy Instagram page.

-   This Khan Academy Privacy Policy does not apply to (and we cannot control the activities of) such other third party websites.
-   You should consult the privacy policies of those third party websites.

Changes to this Privacy Policy
------------------------------

Khan Academy may modify or revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. Khan Academy will notify users of any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the revised Privacy Policy with an updated date of revision on our Service. If we change this Policy in a material manner, we will do our best to notify you of the changes by posting a notice on our website. We recommend that you review the Privacy Policy each time you visit the Service to stay informed of our privacy practices.

We will not make any material changes to our Privacy Policy that relate to the collection or use of Student Personal Data without first giving notice to the School and providing a choice before Student Personal Data are used in a materially different manner than was disclosed when the information was collected.

Schools and Student Use
-----------------------

This School and Student Use notice supplements our Privacy Policy in connection with school use. Khan Academy is a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free educational content. We strive to implement best practices to protect the privacy of all of our student and non-student users, alike. We have implemented additional controls and procedures for schools, school districts and teachers (collectively referred to as "**Schools**") when they use the Service for educational purposes. When the Service is used as part of the School's educational program, the personal information related to the School's student users ("**School Users**") may include information defined as "education records" by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ("**FERPA**") or other information protected by similar state student data privacy laws. We refer to this information as "**Student Personal Data**".

**Our commitment:**We are proud supporters of the¬†[Student Privacy Pledge](https://studentprivacypledge.org/). Our collection and use of Student Personal Data is governed by our contracts with Schools, by our Privacy Policy, and by applicable privacy laws. For example, we work with Schools to protect Student Personal Data consistent with FERPA and, for School Users under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("**COPPA**"). If you have any questions about reviewing, modifying, or deleting the personal information of a School User, please contact your School directly.

**Creation of School Accounts**: Please note that in order for School User accounts to be associated with a School and recognized as School Accounts (as defined in our¬†[Terms of Service](https://www.khanacademy.org/about/tos)), the accounts must be created by or at the direction of a School, using a school email address and associated with a School's class on the Service. For example, a School Account is created when:

-   a teacher creates the user name, login and password to establish School User accounts and creates a class on the Service
-   a teacher rosters a class using Google Classroom, Clever, or similar single sign-on service for School use
-   an account is created by a School User at the direction of a School, using a School email address and associated with a School's class on the Service
-   accounts are created pursuant to a separate contract between Khan Academy and the school district (or educational agency) specifying that the accounts are School Accounts

In cases where we do not have a separate contract with a School district or educational agency, we may require notification that the accounts are used for school purposes in order to recognize them as School Accounts. If you are a School, please contact our¬†[School Partnerships Team](mailto:schoolpartnerships@khanacademy.org)¬†to learn more about how to ensure that student accounts are set up and managed as School Accounts.

#### **Some of the specific ways that we use and protect Student Personal Data**

-   We collect, maintain, use and share Student Personal Data only for authorized educational purposes and as described in our Privacy Policy, including as directed by the School, the School User and/or the student's parent or legal guardian (a "**Parent**").
-   We do not disclose Student Personal Data for targeted advertising purposes. We take steps to disable third party ad networks when a School User logs into a School User account on the Service.
-   We do not build a personal profile of a School User other than in furtherance of an educational purpose or as authorized by a Parent.
-   We have implemented and maintain a data security program designed to protect the types of Student Personal Data collected and used by the Service.
-   We will clearly and transparently disclose our data policies and practices to our users.
-   We will never sell Student Personal Data unless the sale is part of a corporate transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, or other sale of assets, in which case we will require the new owner to continue to honor the terms provided in this Privacy Policy or we will provide the School with notice and an opportunity to opt-out of the transfer of Student Personal Data by deleting the Student Personal Data before the transfer occurs.
-   We will not make any material changes to our Privacy Policy or contractual agreements that relate to the collection or use of Student Personal Data without first giving notice to the School and providing a choice before the Student Personal Data are used in a materially different manner than was disclosed when the information was collected.

#### **How we share and disclose Student Personal Data**

We disclose Student Personal Data in the manner described in our Privacy Policy under the Section entitled¬†[Sharing and disclosure of information](https://www.khanacademy.org/about/privacy-policy#sharing). In addition, depending on the features and account controls applicable to the School Accounts, we may share information with other users on the Service, such as teachers, coaches, or School administrators. If a School User posts content in a community forum, their username and profile information will be visible along with the comment.

Depending on the manner in which Khan Academy is used by a School and the terms of the agreement between the School and Khan Academy, Khan Academy may provide the School with access to certain Student Personal Data, School Account usage information and teacher user account usage information for school purposes, such as monitoring student learning activity and evaluating the effectiveness of the School's use of the Service. Khan Academy may also provide Schools with access to Student Personal Data, Student usage information, and teacher usage information in response to a School's request.

#### **No Targeted Advertising**

Khan Academy does not use, disclose, or compile Student Personal Data of School Users on the Service for the purpose of marketing or advertising commercial products or services, including targeted advertising.

#### **How we retain and delete Student Personal Data**

We will not knowingly retain Student Personal Data beyond the time period required to support an educational purpose, unless authorized to do so by a School, student or Parent. Many of our users continue to use their accounts for a personal, non-School purpose and choose to associate their accounts with a personal account or the account of their Parent. In such cases, the user (or the user's Parent) is responsible for account deletion requests.

Users with personal accounts (or their Parents) can delete their accounts and personal information associated with the account at any time through account Settings. See "[How can I cancel or delete my account](https://khanacademy.zendesk.com/hc/articles/202263014-How-can-I-cancel-or-delete-my-account-)" in the Khan Academy Help Center for instructions.

Depending on the manner in which Khan Academy is used by a School and the terms of an agreement between the School and Khan Academy, users, including School Users (or their Parents) may be able to delete their accounts and personal information associated with the account through account Settings. See "[How can I cancel or delete my account](https://khanacademy.zendesk.com/hc/articles/202263014-How-can-I-cancel-or-delete-my-account-)" in the Khan Academy Help Center for instructions. In some cases our School partners have implemented Khan Academy through an agreement between Khan Academy and the school district or educational agency that includes additional rostering and administrative services; in these cases, School Users (or their Parents) may not be able to delete accounts through account Settings, and deletion requests may need to be referred to the School.

The School is responsible for managing Student Personal Data in accounts that the School no longer needs for an educational purpose by submitting a deletion request. Schools should contact our¬†[School Partnerships Team](mailto:schoolpartnerships@khanacademy.org)¬†to request deletion of Student Personal Data associated with School Accounts. We may request further information from you to verify the authenticity of a deletion request. If a School User has associated their School Account with a personal account, the School User's learning activity may be retained in the personal account.

#### **Questions about Student Personal Data**

If you have questions about specific practices relating to Student Personal Data provided to Khan Academy by a School, please direct your questions to your School.

This section does not apply to information that a student or other individual may provide to Khan Academy independent of the student's use of the Service at the direction of the School. For example, if a user links their existing personal account to their School Account, or elects to retain their Khan Academy learning activity in a personal account, the information associated with the personal account is not considered Student Personal Data.

Children's Privacy Notice
-------------------------

This privacy notice supplements our Privacy Policy and provides additional information about how we collect, use and share personal information from children under the age of 13 (a¬†**"Child"**¬†or¬†**"Children"**).

**Khan Academy is committed to Children's privacy.**

Protecting the privacy of Children is especially important to Khan Academy. For that reason, we created certain features designed to help protect personal information relating to Children ("**Child Users**"). When a Child creates an account, we seek the consent of a parent or legal guardian ("**Parent**") for that account. When Khan Academy is used by a School in an educational setting, we rely on the School to provide the requisite consent, on behalf of the Parent, for Khan Academy to collect information from a School User under the age of 13.

Please review "Learn More" for more information about:

-   How Children can use and register for our Service
-   Restrictions placed on Accounts for Child Users
-   Information collected and how the information is used
-   Information disclosed
-   No Third Party Tracking and No Targeted Advertising
-   Choice: Access, Modify and Delete Child Accounts

#### **How Children can use and register for our Service**

Users may view our content and do exercises without creating an account. Functionality is limited if users do not create an account.

Khan Academy does not knowingly permit Child Users to create an account without the consent of a Parent or School. If Khan Academy learns that personal information of a Child User has been collected on our Service without Parent or School consent, Khan Academy will take appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a Parent and discover that your child under the age of 13 has a registered account with our Service without consent, please¬†[Contact Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/about/privacy-policy#contact)¬†and request that we delete that child's personal information from our systems.

Child Users can sign up for a Khan Academy account in one of the following ways:

#### **A Child User may sign up for a Khan Academy Account with parent consent**

When a Child User registers for our Service, we request a username, birthdate, password, and a Parent's email address so that we can email the Child User's Parent in order to seek consent for the Child to use the Service. Khan Academy does not ask the Child User for any more information than is necessary to provide the Service to the Child User or to seek Parent consent. The Child User is permitted to use the Service for 7 days through a¬†[Restricted Account](https://www.khanacademy.org/about/privacy-policy#restricted)¬†while we notify the Parent and request consent. If we do not receive consent from the Parent within 7 days, the Child User's Restricted Account is closed, and the Child's personal information is deleted from our systems. Khan Academy may rely on a School to provide consent on behalf of a Parent, as described below.

#### **When a Child User account is created by a School, we rely on the School to provide consent**

When the Khan Academy Service is used by a School in an educational setting, we permit the School to create Child User accounts and to provide the requisite consent, on behalf of the Child User's Parent, for Khan Academy to collect personal information of a Child User for this purpose. Schools may create a Child User account by adding students to the Service through Google Classroom, Clever, or similar Single Sign On service, providing a link or class code to join a class, or a School may create logins and passwords for each individual student. When Schools create accounts in this manner, we rely on the consent provided to us by the School and do not require additional consent from the Parent.

#### **Methods for providing Parental consent**

Parents may provide consent for a Child User to use the Service through a Restricted Account by responding affirmatively to an email sent by Khan Academy to the Parent's email address provided by the Child User during registration. If we do not receive consent from the Parent (or confirmation that the account is a School Account) within 7 days, the Child User's account will be closed and the Child's personal information will be deleted from our systems. Restricted Accounts may access and use certain features of the Service in a limited manner.

#### **Parent accounts**

To enable additional functionality for the Child User account and to enable full access and control over the Child User's account activity, the Parent must create a "Parent Account" on the Service and connect to the Child User's account by clicking on the account creation link in the Parental consent notice. Parent Accounts control the settings and functionality of the Child User's account. The Parent can maintain the Child's Restricted Account, and can enable additional account functionality and features, if desired. Parents can revoke a Child User's permissions to use the Service at any time by deleting the account. In some cases, administrative controls including the ability to modify or delete the account, are held by the School.

#### **Restricted Accounts for Child Users**

Khan Academy attempts to restrict a Child User's access to certain features that could result in disclosure of the Child's personal information. A Restricted Account limits sharing and displaying private information about the Child User in various ways.

For example, a Child User with a Restricted Account cannot:

-   Display personal information other than a username. Restricted Accounts contain the Child's username and do not include other personal information or profile information. Because the username may be displayed on the Service, we strongly recommend selecting a username that does not relate to or identify the real name of the Child. The Child's username can be selected or revised by the Parent by creating a Parent Account.
-   Add or edit personal information associated with a Restricted Account.
-   Post to public community forums, or post questions or answers on lessons.
-   Receive emails from Khan Academy (all emails are sent to the Parent email on file).
-   Communicate with or share personal information with Coaches other than a username and Service usage activity (i.e., lessons completed, badges earned, etc.). Similarly, Coaches cannot communicate with a Child User with a Restricted Account except to assign content for the Child User.

#### **What information we collect from a Child User, and how we use this information**

We collect a username, birthdate, and Parent's email address when a Child User registers for the Service, as well as any other personal information a Parent adds to a Child User's account, as described above. We collect information about the Child User's use of the Service (lessons completed, badges earned). We also collect usage and device information, as described in¬†[Collection of information](https://www.khanacademy.org/about/privacy-policy#collection-info).

We use this information to provide the Service and for the purposes described in¬†[Use of information](https://www.khanacademy.org/about/privacy-policy#use-of-info). We use the Parent's email address to communicate messages about the account.

#### **How we disclose information relating to a Child User**

As described above, Restricted Accounts have limited information sharing capabilities. A username and progress information, along with any personal information the Parent added to the Child's profile, is shared with a Coach or teacher added to the Child User's account, though a Parent Account may restrict the Child User from adding Coaches to the account. Parents may also enable additional information sharing features through a Parent Account, for example, by adding profile information and permitting the profile to be shared with Coaches and other users, or enabling the Child User to post content (e.g., questions and answers) to the Service. Parents that enable content-posting features should be aware that a Child User could post personally identifiable information in free-form content on the Service, and should monitor the Child User's posts and delete personal information if needed. We may also disclose personal information of Child Users for business purposes, as described in¬†[Sharing and disclosure of information](https://www.khanacademy.org/about/privacy-policy#sharing).

#### **No Third Party Tracking and No Targeted Advertising**

Khan Academy does not display any targeted advertising on the Service. We do not disclose personal information of Child Users for direct marketing purposes or for targeted advertising purposes. In addition, we take steps to disable third party ad networks on webpages with child-directed content or when a Child User logs into a Restricted Account on the Service.

#### **How to access, modify and delete your Children Accounts**

As a Parent, you have the ability to access and control information about your Child User in the "Your Children" section of your Parent Account. To refuse future collection or use of your child's personal information, you can delete your Child User's Account by following the instructions in our¬†[FAQ](https://khanacademy.zendesk.com/hc/articles/202263014). Please note, you must delete your Child User's accountbeforeyou delete the Parent Account.

If you do not have a Parent Account associated with your Child User's Restricted Account, you may contact us at our¬†[Support page](https://support.khanacademy.org/hc/requests/new)¬†to access or delete the Child User's account. Please note you will need the Child User's username, and we may take steps to authenticate your identity before we can provide access to the Restricted Account.

In some cases, administrative controls including the ability to modify or delete the account, are held by the School and you will need to direct your request to the School. For more information, please review¬†[Schools and Student Use](https://www.khanacademy.org/about/privacy-policy#schools).
